    <h2>Skit Concept</h2>
    <p class="tagline">
      Filmed in the style of an office mockumentary to illustrate professional presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skit features four personalities and one neutral character: <span class="role">Nervous</span>, <span class="role">Arrogant</span>, <span class="role">Disorganized</span>, <span class="role">Good Professional Presence</span>, and <span class="role">Neutral</span> as the meeting conductor.
    </p>

    <h3>Character Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="role">Nervous</span>: Self-conscious, fidgeting, submissive language, fussing with clothing.</li>
      <li><span class="role">Arrogant</span>: Encroaches on space, interrupts, phone on desk, condescending, flirts.</li>
      <li><span class="role">Good PP</span>: Prepared, confident greeting, good posture, “Yes, and…” mindset.</li>
      <li><span class="role">Disorganized</span>: Calls into meeting, rambles, noisy, unprepared.</li>
      <li><span class="role">Neutral</span>: Facilitates the meeting and drives the discussion.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Scenario Structure</h2>

    <p class="scenario-title">Possible Scenario 1</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Five people: meeting lead, two general actors, one Good PP, one Bad PP.</li>
      <li>Good PP arrives prepared, engaged, and professionally dressed.</li>
      <li>Bad PP arrives late, distracted, underprepared, and less engaged.</li>
      <li>The audience is asked to identify good and bad examples of professional presence and reflect on best practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="scenario-title">Scenario 2 (Alternative Flow)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Neutral introduces the meeting and each character enters or joins in turn.</li>
      <li>Scenes highlight nervous language, arrogance, disorganization, and strong professional presence.</li>
      <li>Monologues give insight into each character’s mindset and behavior.</li>
      <li>The scenario emphasizes clothing, engagement, body language, and verbal communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Stats and Takeaways</h2>

    <div class="stat">
      <span class="highlight">Key perception factors:</span>
      Visual appearance, tone of voice, and word choice strongly influence how others perceive you, as discussed in research on communication and professional presence.
    </div>

    <p>
      First impressions form quickly, so professional presence in the first few seconds of an interaction is especially important.
    </p>

    <p class="notes">
      Use the skit and the outline to prompt discussion, ask for audience feedback, and reinforce key points about online presence, phone etiquette, body language, clothing, hygiene, and communication.

      Identifying Actionable Treatment Variation in Episodes of Low Back Pain

      </a>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section alt">
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Low back pain affects a large majority of adults at some point, and treatment expenditures in the United States are substantial each year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite extensive clinical guidance, practice patterns still vary widely, so this project focused on identifying where providers can adjust care pathways to improve outcomes while reducing overall medical costs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The analysis used roughly 33,000 treatment episodes of low back pain from 2015–2016, focusing on how costs concentrate in a small subset of cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest-cost 5 percent of episodes accounted for more than half of total spending, and all of these high-cost cases included surgery at some point, within a clinically homogeneous group of patients with similar health status.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section alt">
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The central question was why patients with similar low back pain conditions can end up on very different treatment trajectories, with some receiving expensive surgical procedures while others receive non-surgical orthopedic care at a much lower cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model supported an analysis of which factors are associated with these divergent pathways, helping highlight levers that clinicians could adjust to steer patients toward effective, lower-cost options when appropriate.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Isolate patients into an approximately clinically homogeneous cohort to reduce confounding by baseline health differences.</li>
      <li>Identify potentially important and actionable features with clinical input, such as imaging use, physical therapy utilization, and key medical history characteristics.</li>
      <li>Address class imbalance so that the model can learn from both common and rare outcome patterns.</li>
      <li>Fit a random forest to a bootstrapped training sample and evaluate performance on a validation subset.</li>
      <li>Interpret feature importance in close collaboration with clinicians to translate model signals into meaningful, actionable insights.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul class="pill-list">
      <li>Random forest</li>
      <li>Class imbalance handling</li>
      <li>Clinical feature engineering</li>
